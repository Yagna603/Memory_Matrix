# Memory_Matrix

A simple online game to test your pictorial memory.

Description of the game :- 
<br>
Given a grid containing  'k' cells (let's say), there will be exactly 'k/2' distinct images hidden behind these 'k' cells where each image will be present exactly twice.
<br>
The user in one move can flip two cells to reveal the images hidden behind them. If the two images match they will stay revealed for the remaining course of the game and if they are not same the cells will flip and the images will become hidden again.
<br>
To complete the game reveal all the images.
